//! The shape of an answer, pinned in a file both sides read.
//!
//! A contract test does not check values - they change with every run - but the **shape**: which keys an
//! answer has and of what type. That is exactly what breaks Kotlin silently when a field is renamed in
//! the core, and exactly what a compiler cannot see across the boundary.
//!
//! The files live in `contract/` next to `commands.json` and are part of the source. When a shape
//! legitimately changes, rerun the tests with `UPDATE_CONTRACT=1`, look at the diff, and commit it - the
//! Kotlin side then fails until its own model is updated.
