//! The settings of a database, and generating a key file.
//!
//! `DbSettings` is a core type in both directions, the fourth and last such place: its fields are
//! private, it exists only through serde, and `set_db_settings` takes the whole thing back. It is also
//! how the credentials are changed - `password_changed` / `key_file_changed` next to the new values -
//! so the ui reads the settings, edits them, and sends them in.
//!
//! A new key file comes back as bytes, for the app to write through SAF - the core no longer writes it
//! itself. A changed key file goes in as content too, `key_file` beside the settings (Step 31):
//! `key_file_name` inside `DbSettings` is the name to show and is never read on the way in.
