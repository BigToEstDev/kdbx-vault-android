//! One module per block of commands, and the pieces every block needs.
//!
//! `dispatch` keeps the match over `Command` - that is where the compiler checks nothing was forgotten -
//! and the work itself lives here, a file per block of the api: the life cycle of a database file,
//! groups, entries, and so on. With around forty five commands in v1 a single file would be long past
//! the point where the match is readable, and a block is exactly the unit that gets added, reviewed and
//! tested together.
//!
//! What a handler is: a function taking the json of its arguments (and the bytes, when the command
//! carries a database) and returning an `Answer`. Nothing else - no locking, no state of its own. The
//! core owns the open databases.
